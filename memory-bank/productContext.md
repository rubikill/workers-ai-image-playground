# Product Context: Workers AI Image Playground

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
- **AI Image Generation Complexity**: Traditional AI image generation requires technical knowledge of model parameters and API integration
- **Limited Accessibility**: Most AI image generators are either too complex for casual users or too expensive for experimentation
- **Storage and Management**: Users need a way to store, organize, and retrieve their generated images
- **Cloudflare Ecosystem**: Leveraging Cloudflare's edge computing and AI capabilities for optimal performance

### Solution Value
- **Democratized AI**: Makes AI image generation accessible to everyone through a simple interface
- **Edge Performance**: Leverages Cloudflare's global edge network for fast image generation
- **Cost-Effective**: Uses Cloudflare's competitive pricing for AI services
- **Integrated Experience**: Combines generation, storage, and management in one application

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Landing**: User arrives at a clean, modern interface with clear call-to-action
2. **Model Selection**: User chooses from available AI models (currently flux-1-schnell)
3. **Parameter Configuration**: Dynamic form adapts to selected model's schema
4. **Image Generation**: User submits prompt and waits for AI generation
5. **Preview**: Generated image appears with download options
6. **Gallery**: User can browse all previously generated images
7. **Download**: User can download images in high quality

### Core User Flows

#### Image Generation Flow
```
Home Page → Model Selection → Parameter Input → Generate → Preview → Download
```

#### Gallery Management Flow
```
Gallery Page → Browse Images → View Details → Download → Return to Generator
```

### User Experience Principles
- **Simplicity**: One-click image generation with intelligent defaults
