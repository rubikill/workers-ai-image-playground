    -   Each task should have a clear description and acceptance criteria.
-   **Progress Tracking:**
    -   At the beginning of a work session, ask for the current focus and update the task list accordingly (e.g., moving a task to "In Progress").
    -   At the end of a work session, summarize the completed tasks and update the task list.
-   **Communication:**
    -   Provide clear and concise updates on project status.
    -   Help to identify any blockers or impediments.
