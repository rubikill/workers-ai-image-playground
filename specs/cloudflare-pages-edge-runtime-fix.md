# Cloudflare Pages Edge Runtime Fix

## Issue

When deploying to Cloudflare Pages, the build failed with the following error:

```
⚡️ ERROR: Failed to produce a Cloudflare Pages build from the project.
⚡️
⚡️ 	The following routes were not configured to run with the Edge Runtime:
⚡️ 	  - /images/[id]
⚡️
⚡️ 	Please make sure that all your non-static routes export the following edge runtime route segment config:
⚡️ 	  export const runtime = 'edge';
```

## Root Cause

The dynamic route `/images/[id]` was created as a client-side component but didn't have the required edge runtime configuration for Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Solution

Added the edge runtime configuration to the dynamic image detail page:

```typescript
// app/images/[id]/page.tsx
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

## Technical Details

### Why Edge Runtime is Required

Cloudflare Pages requires all non-static routes to use the Edge Runtime for:
- **Performance**: Faster cold starts and response times
- **Compatibility**: Works with Cloudflare's edge network
- **Consistency**: All routes run in the same environment

### Implementation

The fix was simple - just add the runtime export:

```typescript
"use client";

import Image from "next/image";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
// ... other imports

export const runtime = 'edge'; // ← Added this line

type R2Image = {
  // ... type definition
};

export default function ImageDetailPage() {
  // ... component implementation
}
```

### Build Result

After adding the edge runtime configuration:

```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (5/5)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization

## Best Practices

### For Cloudflare Pages Deployment

1. **All Dynamic Routes**: Must export `export const runtime = 'edge'`
2. **API Routes**: Should also use edge runtime for consistency
3. **Static Routes**: Can remain static (no runtime export needed)

### Edge Runtime Considerations

1. **Node.js APIs**: Not available in edge runtime
2. **File System**: Limited access in edge runtime
3. **Memory**: Limited memory compared to Node.js runtime
4. **Dependencies**: Must be edge-compatible

### Alternative Approaches

If edge runtime is not suitable, consider:
1. **Static Generation**: Pre-generate pages at build time
2. **API Routes**: Move dynamic logic to API routes
3. **Client-Side Only**: Keep all logic in client components
